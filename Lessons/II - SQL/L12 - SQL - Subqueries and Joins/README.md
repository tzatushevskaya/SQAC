# Lesson Plan: Subqueries and Joins in SQL

1. **Introduction to Subqueries**
   - Overview of subqueries and their role in SQL
   - Understanding the syntax and structure of subqueries
   - Types of subqueries: scalar, column, and table subqueries

2. **Scalar Subqueries**
   - Using scalar subqueries to return a single value
   - Incorporating scalar subqueries in SELECT, WHERE, and other clauses

3. **Column Subqueries**
   - Using column subqueries to return a single column
   - Utilizing column subqueries in SELECT, WHERE, and FROM clauses

4. **Table Subqueries**
   - Understanding table subqueries and their ability to return multiple rows and columns
   - Examples of table subqueries in SELECT, WHERE, and FROM clauses

5. **Correlated Subqueries**
   - Exploring correlated subqueries and their relationship with outer queries
   - Identifying scenarios where correlated subqueries are useful

6. **Introduction to Joins**
   - Overview of joins and their purpose in SQL
   - Understanding different types of joins: INNER JOIN, LEFT JOIN, RIGHT JOIN, FULL JOIN

7. **INNER JOIN**
   - Using INNER JOIN to retrieve matching records from two or more tables
   - Syntax and examples of INNER JOIN

8. **LEFT JOIN**
   - Understanding LEFT JOIN and its role in retrieving records from the left table along with matching records from the right table (if any)
   - Syntax and examples of LEFT JOIN

9. **RIGHT JOIN**
   - Understanding RIGHT JOIN and its role in retrieving records from the right table along with matching records from the left table (if any)
   - Syntax and examples of RIGHT JOIN

10. **FULL JOIN**
   - Understanding FULL JOIN and its role in retrieving all records from both tables, with NULL values for unmatched records
   - Syntax and examples of FULL JOIN

11. **Combining Subqueries and Joins**
   - Integrating subqueries with joins to create complex queries
   - Examples demonstrating the use of subqueries and joins together

12. **Review and Practice**
   - Review of key concepts covered in the lesson
