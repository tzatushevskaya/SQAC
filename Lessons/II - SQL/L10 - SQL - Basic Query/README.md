# Lesson Plan: SQL Querying Techniques

1. **Retrieve everything from a table**
   - Using the SELECT statement to retrieve all columns from a table

2. **Retrieve specific columns from a table**
   - Specifying desired columns in the SELECT statement

3. **Control which rows are retrieved**
   - Using the WHERE clause to filter rows based on specified conditions

4. **Control which rows are retrieved - part 2**
   - Further exploration of WHERE clause with additional filtering conditions

5. **Basic string searches**
   - Performing string searches using the LIKE operator and wildcards

6. **Matching against multiple possible values**
   - Using the IN operator to match values against a list of possibilities

7. **Classify results into buckets**
   - Categorizing query results using the CASE statement

8. **Working with dates**
   - Handling date and time data types in SQL queries
   - Performing date calculations and comparisons

9. **Removing duplicates, and ordering results**
   - Using DISTINCT keyword to remove duplicate rows
   - Sorting query results using the ORDER BY clause

10. **Combining results from multiple queries**
   - Using the UNION operator to combine results from multiple SELECT statements

11. **Simple aggregation**
   - Using aggregate functions (e.g., SUM, AVG, COUNT) to perform basic aggregation

12. **More aggregation**
   - Exploring advanced aggregation techniques and functions (e.g., GROUP BY, HAVING)
