   - Understanding the difference between UI testing and API testing
   - Exploring the benefits of API test automation for validating backend functionality and integrations

2. **Types of APIs**
   - Introduction to different types of APIs (e.g., RESTful APIs, SOAP APIs, GraphQL APIs)
   - Understanding the characteristics and usage of each type of API

3. **API Testing Tools and Frameworks**
   - Overview of popular API testing tools and frameworks (e.g., Postman, RestAssured, Karate, SoapUI)
   - Exploring features, capabilities, and usage of each tool/framework

4. **Setting Up API Testing Environment**
   - Installing and configuring API testing tools/frameworks
   - Setting up project structure and dependencies for API test automation

5. **Basics of HTTP Protocol**
   - Understanding the Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) and its role in API communication
   - Explaining HTTP methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE) and status codes (2xx, 3xx, 4xx, 5xx)

6. **API Testing Fundamentals**
   - Exploring fundamental concepts of API testing:
      - Endpoint testing
      - Request and response structure
      - Parameterization and data-driven testing
      - Authentication and authorization
      - Error handling and validation

7. **Writing API Test Cases**
   - Writing API test cases for basic CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete)
   - Designing test scenarios to cover positive and negative test cases
   - Implementing assertions to validate response data and status codes

8. **Automating API Tests**
   - Automating API tests using chosen testing tool/framework
   - Writing automated test scripts to execute API test cases
   - Handling test data, environment variables, and configuration for automated tests

9. **Test Data Management**
   - Managing test data for API tests using static data, dynamic data, and test data generation techniques
   - Implementing data-driven testing for API test automation

10. **API Test Execution and Reporting**
   - Executing automated API tests locally and in CI/CD pipelines
   - Generating test reports and logs for API test execution analysis and debugging
   - Integrating API tests with test management and reporting tools

11. **Continuous Integration for API Tests**
   - Integrating API tests into Continuous Integration (CI) pipelines for automated testing
   - Configuring CI/CD tools (e.g., Jenkins, GitLab CI) to run API tests automatically on code changes

12. **Mocking and Stubbing APIs**
   - Introduction to API mocking and stubbing for testing API interactions
   - Using mocking tools/frameworks (e.g., WireMock, MockServer) to simulate API responses

13. **Security Testing for APIs**
   - Understanding the importance of security testing for APIs
   - Exploring common security vulnerabilities (e.g., OWASP Top 10) and techniques for API security testing

14. **Load and Performance Testing**
   - Introduction to load and performance testing for APIs
   - Using load testing tools (e.g., JMeter, Gatling) to simulate high loads and measure API performance

15. **Best Practices and Guidelines**
   - Best practices for API test automation, including test design, test data management, test execution, and reporting
   - Guidelines for writing clean, maintainable, and efficient API test code

16. **Real-World Applications and Projects**
   - Analysis of real-world applications and projects using API test automation
   - Identifying testing practices and benefits observed in real-world development scenarios

17. **Review and Practice**
   - Review of key concepts covered in the lesson
   - Hands-on exercises and projects to reinforce understanding of API test automation fundamentals
