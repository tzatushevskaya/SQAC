   - Understanding expressions and their evaluation in Java

6. **Control Flow Statements**
   - Using conditional statements (if-else, switch-case) to control program flow
   - Using loop statements (for, while, do-while) for iteration and repetitive tasks

7. **Arrays**
   - Introduction to arrays in Java and their usage for storing multiple values of the same type
   - Understanding array declaration, initialization, and manipulation

8. **Methods**
   - Defining and invoking methods in Java
   - Understanding method parameters, return types, and method overloading

9. **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) Concepts**
   - Understanding the principles of object-oriented programming (OOP)
   - Exploring OOP concepts such as classes, objects, encapsulation, inheritance, and polymorphism

10. **Classes and Objects**
   - Defining classes and creating objects in Java
   - Understanding class members (e.g., fields, methods) and their access modifiers

11. **Constructors and Constructors Overloading**
   - Understanding constructors and their role in object initialization
   - Exploring constructor overloading to create objects with different initialization parameters

12. **Inheritance**
   - Understanding inheritance and its relationship between classes in Java
   - Implementing inheritance using extends keyword and accessing superclass members

13. **Polymorphism**
   - Understanding polymorphism and its types (e.g., method overloading, method overriding)
   - Exploring dynamic method dispatch and runtime polymorphism

   - Understanding exception propagation, finally block, and custom exception classes

16. **File Handling**
   - Reading from and writing to files in Java using input/output streams
   - Understanding file handling operations (e.g., reading text files, writing data to files)

17. **Collections Framework**
   - Overview of the Java Collections Framework (e.g., List, Set, Map)
   - Exploring collection classes and their usage for storing and manipulating data

18. **Generics**
   - Understanding generics and their usage for creating parameterized types in Java
