   - Understanding the characteristics and principles of each paradigm

3. **Procedural Programming**
   - Introduction to procedural programming concepts
   - Understanding procedural programming languages and their features
   - Exploring basic procedural programming constructs (e.g., variables, data types, control structures)

4. **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)**
   - Introduction to object-oriented programming concepts
   - Understanding OOP principles (e.g., encapsulation, inheritance, polymorphism)
   - Exploring object-oriented programming languages and their features

5. **Functional Programming**
   - Introduction to functional programming concepts
   - Understanding functional programming principles (e.g., immutability, higher-order functions, recursion)
   - Exploring functional programming languages and their features

6. **Integrated Development Environments (IDEs)**
   - Overview of IDEs and their role in software development
   - Exploring popular IDEs (e.g., Visual Studio Code, IntelliJ IDEA, PyCharm)
   - Understanding features and tools provided by IDEs for code editing, debugging, and project management

7. **Libraries and Frameworks**
   - Understanding the difference between libraries and frameworks
   - Exploring popular programming libraries and frameworks in different languages (e.g., React.js, TensorFlow, Django)

8. **Version Control Systems (VCS)**
   - Introduction to version control systems and their importance in collaborative software development
   - Exploring popular VCS tools (e.g., Git, Subversion)
   - Understanding basic version control operations (e.g., commit, push, pull)

9. **Package Management**
   - Introduction to package management systems and their role in dependency management
   - Exploring package managers in different programming languages (e.g., npm for Node.js, pip for Python)
   - Understanding how package management simplifies library and framework installation and updates

10. **Documentation and Commenting**
   - Importance of documentation and commenting in programming
